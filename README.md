# GraphMinCut

  - This is a simple yet very fast and efficient implementation of Karger's randomized algorithm to find Minimum cut of a undirected Graph.
  - Using Numpy instead of list just boosts the computational speed manyfolds.
  - If your graph txt file doesn't end each vertices and node line with "\n" then remove "[:-1]" from line 10
